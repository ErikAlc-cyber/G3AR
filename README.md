# G3AR
A custom Assitant for the youtuber G3AR, anyway feel free to tweak it

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Currently im working in the develop of the assistant so many of the features can have bugs and a lot of "trash code" but if you want to change something of the code, you are welcome to help.

The main file is main.py, there the file itself will explain every function and line does, in spanish and english. There are some files like anime voice.wav that are useless but  you can use them as you wish.

In testcode.py i test some codes 'cause this is more like a passion project so im learning while doing it, so there i code small part so if you delete it it wont affect anything
